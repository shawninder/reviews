I had the pleasure of working with Shawn Inder as his direct supervisor during an internship at École Polytechnique, Montréal. Shawn had the responsibility of working with one other student intern on developing a web application to manage and promote international student exchange programs at the institution. We had numerous meetings to discuss my needs, the needs of administrators, and also the needs of students.

Shawn is an excellent listener and definitely a people person. I was very impressed with his clear and quick understanding of my needs and his ability to translate these into the application. He is a rigorous and hard worker. He is also a solution-focused, creative thinker, often coming up with new solutions and ideas. I felt I was working with a mature professional rather than a student.

As I was not able to comment directly on his technical ability, an IT and Software Engineering Professor also supervised his work, and often told me how impressed he was with Shawn, and how he was well documenting his code, etc.

To conclude, great colleagues most often shine because of their great personalities and interpersonal skills, which carry them far beyond the technical work accomplished. This is Shawn's case and I would never hesitate to hire him again.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require further information.
